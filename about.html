            Kate Thompson is a senior at Cuyahoga State University, originally from Los Angeles, California. This spring
            she will receive her B.A. in English
            with a minor in Creative Writing. During her time at Cuyahoga State she worked closely with Write Youth, a
            non-profit organization dedicated
            to promoting childhood literacy. With WriteYouth Kate has led creative writing workshops at over 20
            elementary schools throughout the
            greater Chicago area. As a writer Kate's short stories and essays have appeared in numerous online
            publications, including
            most notably the Loss Angeles Times this past winter. When Kate is not writing or leading workshops, she
            enjoys running,
            singing, and playing the piano.
